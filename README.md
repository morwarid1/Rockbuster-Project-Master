# Rockbuster Stealth Data Analysis Project

Rockbuster Stealth LLC is a movie rental company. The Management team is planning to use its existing movie License to launch an online video rental service. My rule as a data analyst is to help with the launch strategy for the new online video service. My first task is to load all of the Rockbuster's data into a relational database management system (RDBMS) then answer any ad-hoc business questions that other department may have using SQL. The Data Set contains information about Rockbuster's film, inventory, customers, and payments, among other things.

**Key Questions:**
- Which movies contributed the most/least to revenue gain?
- What was the average rental duration for all videos?
- Which countries are Rockbuster customers based in?
- Where are customers with a high lifetime value-based?
- Do sales figures vary between geographic regions?

This project helped me develop the ability to solve problems for a variety of clients that could be applied to any project and industry.
